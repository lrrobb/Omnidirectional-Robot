# Omnidirectional-Robot
Omnidirectional Robot with Motion Tracking Abilities Simulates Walking for Virtual Reality Realism.
This is an in progress prototype design for the robot. The idea is to have two of these arms working together. They will be connected to Virtual Reality and will simulate the
terrain in VR. As you walk in real life, the two robot arms will catch your feet. They will slowly move you back, so you can keep walking infinitely. Walking in real life
will then be transferred to walking in the game, giving a more immersive experience.
